# Chat-Application

I developed a Full stack Chat application using MERN stack (Mongo Express ReactJS NodeJS). The client side was developed using Vite (I prefer Vite to Create React App for bootstrapping due to its lower bundle size and speed) 
and ReactJS. For styling, I used tailwind CSS for its rich set of utility classes.

Used Mongo Atlas to setup the database to store messages of a user and implemented authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens(JWTs). Web Socket protocol was implemented to facilitate communication.

Also features like user avatars, online indicator, file upload were also developed.
